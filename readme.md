# Lazy-student

Because of corona virus, this semester is full online. the problem is each course has different update pattern. so hard to know all at once. And I just happen to learn about web scraping and thought using this method, I can make this thing a lot more easier.

I don't know how to code python. but with this project I learned so much things about python. and got to know why people like this language.

## project process

> 05.09-05.12

Learn how to use selenium.
Auto login, searching my courses and find updated video, finally play it!

It was amazing to see my code automatically interact with e-learning website. and so much fun to learn like this new feature.

And I learned other things like python's virtual environment , PyQt5 for program's gui.

> 05.13-

Pause project. I have to study python basic and project architecture. and crawling model structure so I read book and practice how to make nice scraper.
